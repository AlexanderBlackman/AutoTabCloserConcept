# AutoTabCloserConcept
A chrome/brave extension I whipped up to make me more mindful about jumping back and forth between tabs.
When active, it closes the previous tab when you switch to a different tab.

Note my Javascript knowledge is still pretty basic, so user beware.  I'll try to improve it as my knowledge improves.
